Ideas:
    - Make a centralized one that lets people make their own group for like $1
      or something.
    - Either anonymous posting with captcha, or captcha to create account then
      no captcha.
    - Add encryption. Use # at the end of the URL to provide a key (i.e. like
      cryptocat but for newsgroups).
