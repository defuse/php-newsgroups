PHASE 1
==========

    ** ISSUE

        There is an inconsidency in the way we do constructors.
        Some accept the name, some accept the id.
        I think it's ok for user to accept the name, but groups should be
        changed to accept id, and all other code should be changed to give id
        (e.g. forms), and where possible, provide a method for translating from
        name to id.

        Also, all constructurs MUST check that the thing actually exists

        **

        - Apply permissions to write (newpost, replypost)
            - Do we want to hide the reply button?
            - Do we want to hide the new post button?
                - (to both), no, as it's better to make it obvious that they
                  can't reply. we'll show a friendly message on the page that
                  comes up when they click it
                - or should we just "disable" the button? <-- this is best?
        - Fix inconsitencies (see above)



PHASE 3
===========

- Explore better ACL ideas... the current is kind of a pain in the ass.
- Make double click viewing work
- Users can delete THEIR OWN post if there are no replies.
- Admins can recursively delete a post (even if there are replies).
    - Anonymous can't delete anybody's posts (not even their own)
- Admin panel:
    - Disable/enable/delete user accounts
- User settings page, with the ability to select which groups to show in the
  sidebar. 
- Security audit.
- Able to mark as unread when seen.
- Admin can force change a password.
- Add the ability to rename things
- Make sure "" is not allowed as a username
- Make sure username length is limited lower than db field lengths
   - and all other strings like uc names, group names, etc
- Write a watir test suite.
- Write unit tests.


- Set up optimal database indexes

- Code documentation
    - Extensive documentation of the database tables, and code overview
    - Goal: redragonx can hack the code after reading it
    - Keep it as short as possible

- Setup script

- Make a max-width textarea (set the cols count but make it not have a border so
  it 'looks' like it's putting hard breaks, then hard break it server side)
- Other syntax like * (bold), / (italics), and _ (underline)

- Are new posts and replies added (by javascript) in the right order? (Don't
  assume order from server)
- Use 'id' instead of time for the auto refresh to avoid race conditions (and
  faster search).
- when a child post is selected and the list is minimized, the outer one should
  be highlighted (like thunderbird)
- Indicate when a thread has been replied to by the current user (like tb's
  arrow)
- make sure post subject line isn't empty
- stop admins from deleting themselves

- signatures (config in settings, just default appends at the bottom)

- email alerts.

Questionable:
- sort posts by activity (new posts are top but very active ones are on top
  also)
- reply count
- bigger new post button
- 'My Posts' option to view your own posts (lists all the threads you're active
  in)


SHIT FROM WHITEBOARD (needs to be prioritized)
=========================================

- Show whether group is read only or not
- Show when a group has unread posts (count?)
- Are new posts and replies added (by JS) in the right order?
- Add a 'check for new posts' (refresh) button
- Use id instead of time
- Test UI and HTML validity
- DONE UI is broken in chrome
- Ability to set pseudo-username (saved in cookie) when anon
- Ability to link to a specific post
- Case insensitive username
